# Vision & Mission

#### Focus on value transfer

All layering and improvement of peripheral functions are centered on promoting value transfer.



#### Consensus layered governance

not all cognition requires global consensus, and consensus also requires layering. The lower layer focuses more on security and decentralization, and the upper layer focuses on performance and convenience.



#### Technology creates possibilities, and the community decides the trade-offs

try to eliminate differences through technology, create possibilities, maintain technology neutrality, and leave the choices and trade-offs at the value level to the community.
