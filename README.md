:clap: Welcome to the Starcoin Wiki!



Starcoin is a decentralized layered smart contract network that aims to provide a secure digital asset and decentralized financial operation platform.



The infinitely scalable smart contract blockchain network is realized through layering, the first layer ensures security and no access, and the second layer realizes application-oriented expansion, thus becoming the infrastructure of Web3 and the Metaverse.
